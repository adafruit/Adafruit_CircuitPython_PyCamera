Library for the Adafruit PyCamera


Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_
* `Bus Device <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BusDevice>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://circuitpython.org/libraries>`_
or individual libraries can be installed using
`circup <https://github.com/adafruit/circup>`_.



.. ::
    `Purchase one from the Adafruit shop <http://www.adafruit.com/products/9999>`_

Installing from PyPI
=====================

This package is available on PyPI so that it can be installed by Thonny. It is
not useful to install this package from PyPI on a Windows, Mac, or Linux
computer.

Installing to a Connected CircuitPython Device with Circup
==========================================================

Make sure that you have ``circup`` installed in your Python environment.
Install it with the following command if necessary:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip3 install circup

With ``circup`` installed and your CircuitPython device connected use the
following command to install:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup install adafruit_pycamera

Or the following command to update an existing version:

.. code-block:: shell

    circup update

Usage Example
=============

.. code-block: python

    from adafruit_pycamera import PyCamera

    pycam = PyCamera()

    while True:
        new_frame = pycam.continuous_capture()
        # .. do something with new_frame
